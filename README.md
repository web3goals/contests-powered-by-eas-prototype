## ✨ About

The number of web3 online hackathons is growing every year. But the main problem is that most often the participants don't get any feedback from the judges that could help them get better. Only the winners get awards and some attention.

So, most of the participants become sad and unhappy. They wasted their time. And they lose motivation to participate in such events anymore.

To solve this problem, I built a web3 application that helps organize contests valuable to everyone, not just the winners.

And this app is suitable for any type of contest, not only for web3 hackathons.

## ⚒️ How it's made

- Base network is used to store contracts that give people the ability to create social profiles, start contests, evaluate them, and send feedback.
- Ethereum Attestation Service is used to make onchain attestations when a user starts a contest or judges participants.
- The project also uses such technologies as Solidity, TypeScript, HardHat, Next.js.

## 🔮 What's next

- Create a super app that includes all the features for running contests in one place.
- Enable email notifications for judges and participants.
- Add gasless transaction.
- Implement quadratic and community voting.
